# ðŸŽ§ Morse Transmitter

Many headphones can send commands to its device, such as Airpods, with a single press to pause or resume, double press to play the next track, and triple press to play the previous track.

Using this feature, we can use the headphones as a morse transmitter.

## Demo

If you're using an Airpod, a single press sends a dit (.) , a double press sends a dah(-), and a triple press deletes the previous character.

When the delay time is reached, the dit and dah codes in the input will be converted to a letter or number.

Shorter delays allow faster input, but also increase the chance of errors.
