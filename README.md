# 🎧 Morse Transmitter

Many headphones can send commands to its device, such as Airpods, with a single press to pause or resume, double press to play the next track, and triple press to play the previous track.

Using this feature, we can use the headphones as a morse transmitter.

When the `delay` time is reached, the `.` and `-` codes in the input buffer will be flushed.

If you don't want to use a headphone, you can also use the multimedia keys on the keyboard, which can even set a shorter delay, such as 500ms:
